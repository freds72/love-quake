## How to launch

- configure game_conf.lua to reflect Quake install
```
    root_path="<path to ID1 folder or local root for custom maps",
```
> install contains player.mdl and v_shot.mdl (copyright ID) to support standalone tests

- launch with the selected map:
```
    &love.exe game q8k e1m3.bsp
```
